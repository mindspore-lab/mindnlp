If you're interested in making your pipeline even faster, take a look at the following resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn how [PyTorch 2.0](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/./optimization/fp16) and [`torch.compile`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.compile.html) can yield 5 - 300% faster inference speed. On an A100 GPU, inference can be up to 50% faster!\n",
    "- If you can't use PyTorch 2, we recommend you install [xFormers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/./optimization/xformers). Its memory-efficient attention mechanism works great with PyTorch 1.13.1 for faster speed and reduced memory consumption.\n",
    "- Other optimization techniques, such as model offloading, are covered in [this guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/./optimization/fp16)."
