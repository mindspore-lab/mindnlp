This makes it a useful tool for image restoration like removing defects and artifacts, or even replacing an image area with something entirely new.

The white pixels are filled in by the prompt.\n",

    "It is important to specify `output_type=\"latent\"` in the pipeline to keep all the outputs in latent space to avoid an unnecessary decode-encode step. This only works if the chained pipelines are using the same VAE. For example, in the [Text-to-image-to-inpaint](#text-to-image-to-inpaint) section, Kandinsky 2.2 uses a different VAE class than the Stable Diffusion model so it won't work. But if you use Stable Diffusion v1.5 for both pipelines, then you can keep everything in latent space because they both use [AutoencoderKL](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/models/autoencoderkl#diffusers.AutoencoderKL).\n",
