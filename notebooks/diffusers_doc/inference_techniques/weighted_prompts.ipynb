But crafting a great prompt takes time and effort and sometimes it may not be enough because language and words can be imprecise. This is where you need to boost your prompt with other techniques, such as prompt enhancing and prompt weighting, to get the results you want.\n",

    "2. What is the image *subject*? Is it a person, animal, object, or scene?\n",
    "3. What *details* would you like to see in the image? This is where you can get really creative and have a lot of fun experimenting with different words to bring your image to life. For example, what is the lighting like? What is the vibe and aesthetic? What kind of art or illustration style are you looking for? The more specific and precise words you use, the better the model will understand what you want to generate.\n",

A prompt can include several concepts, which gets turned into contextualized text embeddings.
