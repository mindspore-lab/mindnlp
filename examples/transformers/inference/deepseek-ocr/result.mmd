# R&D QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTION/SOLUTION FORM  


Name/Phone Ext.: M. Hamann, P. Harper, P. Martinez Date: 9/3/92  


Supervisor/Manager: J. S. Wigand R&D Group: Licensee  


Suggestion: Discontinue coal retention analyses on licensee submitted product samples. (Note: Coal Retention testing is not performed by most licensees. Other B&W physical measurements as ends stability and inspection for soft spots in cigarettes are thought to be sufficient measures to assure cigarette physical integrity. The proposed action will increase laboratory productivity.)  


Suggested Solution(s): Delete coal retention from the list of standard analyses performed on licensee submitted product samples. Special requests for coal retention testing could still be submitted on an exception basis.
