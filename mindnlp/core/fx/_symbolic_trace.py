    This function can be called at module-level scope to register fn_or_name as a "leaf function".
    A "leaf function" will be preserved as a CallFunction node in the FX trace instead of being
    traced through::

        # foo/bar/baz.py
        def my_custom_function(x, y):
            return x * x + y * y


        torch.fx.wrap("my_custom_function")


        def fn_to_be_traced(x, y):
            # When symbolic tracing, the below call to my_custom_function will be inserted into
            # the graph rather than tracing it.
            return my_custom_function(x, y)

    This function can also equivalently be used as a decorator::

        # foo/bar/baz.py
        @torch.fx.wrap
        def my_custom_function(x, y):
            return x * x + y * y

    A wrapped function can be thought of a "leaf function", analogous to the concept of
    "leaf modules", that is, they are functions that are left as calls in the FX trace
    rather than traced through.
